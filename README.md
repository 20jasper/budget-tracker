# My Awesome Project
This project is a budget tracker to help the user keep track of their finances.

**Link to project:** --Do we want to host this?? or everyone just hosts their own?

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, monogoDB 

This project was built by a team at the 100Devs Agency using HTML, CSS and JS on the front end. Node.js was used for the backend language and all of the information was stored in mongoDB. This project was built with the MVC paradigm to maximize organization. 

## Optimizations

Not sure what to put here and would love some help --

## Lessons Learned:
When building an application that relies heavily on user input of data through forms it isvery important to guide the user and ensure forms have requirments so the correct information is being passed in. 

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

I learnt that Type='Number' is required if you wish a Number to be posted to the MongoDB database.

## Things to add

This program works, however in the future it would be great to:
-build out a more features for time based tracking, possibly calander GUI 
-Additionally it would be great to have comparison tools such as spending history month over month and year over year to make it easier for the user to compare different periods.
